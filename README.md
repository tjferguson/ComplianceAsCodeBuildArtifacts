# ComplianceAsCodeBuildArtifacts
Build Artifacts for Compliance as Code OSCAP outputs (from master branch)

The main purpose of this is that I needed the OSCAP XCCDF outputs for Ubuntu 20.04 that are not included in the existing OSCAP packages for Ubuntu 20.04.

These are simply build artifacts of the current master branch from:
